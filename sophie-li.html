	<p>Signs say not to feed the wildlife, but it was pretty obvious these animals were being fed, given that they actively approached people to look for food</p>

	<p>Mistaya Canyon</p>

	<p>This was a seven day trip. Why do I have so few pictures, you may ask? Because I dropped my phone into the canyon. Yes, that one right there, with the gorgeous rushing water. That was the shot that sent my phone over the edge. I thought it was gone forever. But since this is Canada, and since Canadians are nice people, I somehow, miraculously, had my phone shipped back to me 2 days later, undamaged, before I even left the country. True story.</p>
